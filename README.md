# svd-downdate-klip

Code to accompany "Unlocking starlight subtraction in full data rate exoplanet imaging by efficiently updating Karhunen-Lo√®ve eigenimages" by Joseph D. Long (@joseph-long) and Jared R. Males (@jaredmales) (submitted).

## Usage

**This code is provided in hope that it will be useful and informative, but without documentation beyond that included in the source (and, of course, the paper).** We would recommend implementing the algorithm from the text yourself, as there are many more features you would want in a research tool that would only complicate a proof of concept and benchmarking tool.

You will need several Python packages and a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU to run the tests and benchmarks. The conda environment used to perform the benchmarks is serialized as `klipbenchmark_env.yml`. If you use conda, `conda create -f ./klipbenchmark_env.yml` should leave you able to `conda activate klipbenchmark` and get an equivalent environment to the one we used. You can then run `pytest` from this directory and test the implementation. `benchmark_snr.py` is also relatively self-contained, and will download the example beta Pic NACO dataset itself when run.

Our implementation of the "SVD downdate" can be found in the `minimal_downdate()` function in `starbgone.py`. An example of an end-to-end calculation from data cube to SNR can be found in `calc_snr()` in `benchmark_snr.py`.

Benchmarks were conducted on the University of Arizona HPC cluster _Ocelote_, and PBS batch scripts to reproduce `combined_out_benchmark_scaling.csv` and `out_benchmark_snr.csv` are available upon request.
